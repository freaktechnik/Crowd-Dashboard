Crowd-Dashboard
===============
Crowd Dashboard aims to provide an independent website status page. It uses a client side js library to detect the online status of servers. After the first load, it can be stored on the users computer, so the original server doesn't need to be working anymore and the dashboard still works.

It uses simple JSON objects to create the lists.
